|1. [Analysis of Computer Game Sales](https://github.com/Sklyan1878/portfolio/blob/main/1.%20game_sales.ipynb) |From open sources, historical data on sales of a computer game store are available: user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms. The goal is to identify the patterns that determine a game's success, which will help promote a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SciPy-4c9acb) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Seaborn-0b80ff) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-EDA-8f4bc1) |
|2. [Comments classification](https://github.com/Sklyan1878/portfolio/blob/main/2.%20comments_classification.ipynb)| The online store "WikiShop" is launching a new service. Now, users can edit and supplement product descriptions, much like in wiki communities. This means that customers can suggest their edits and comment on the changes of others. The store needs a tool that will identify toxic comments and forward them for moderation.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-nltk-cb3e7b) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Bert-green) |
|3. [Tariff Recommendations](https://github.com/Sklyan1878/portfolio/blob/main/3.%20tariff_recommendations.ipynb) |The mobile operator wants to build a system capable of analyzing customer behavior and suggesting a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra". The goal is to build a classification model with the highest possible accuracy value, which will select the appropriate tariff.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Seaborn-0b80ff) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) |
|4. [Determining the Temperature of the Alloy](https://github.com/Sklyan1878/portfolio/blob/main/4.%20steel_temperature.ipynb) |To optimize production costs, the metallurgical plant "Tak zakalyaem stal" LLC decided to reduce electricity consumption during the steel processing stage. Your task is to build a model that will predict the temperature of the steel.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Seaborn-0b80ff) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-EDA-8f4bc1)  |
|5. [Well Location Selection](https://github.com/Sklyan1878/portfolio/blob/main/5.%20well_location.ipynb) | Oil samples from three regions have been provided: in each, there are 100000 deposits where the oil quality and its reserves volume have been measured. It is necessary to construct a machine learning model that will help determine the region where production will yield the highest profit. Analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrap technique.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SciPy-4c9acb) |
|6. [Gold Recovery from Ore](https://github.com/Sklyan1878/portfolio/blob/main/6.%20gold_recovery.ipynb) | The model will help optimize production to avoid running operations with unprofitable characteristics. The process of gold recovery from gold-bearing ore needs to be modeled. To do this, the enrichment efficiency must be calculated â€“ it's necessary to determine the gold share in concentrates and tailings. Not only the final product is important, but also the rough concentrate.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matplotlib-9cf) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-EDA-8f4bc1) |
|7. [Taxi Order Prediction](https://github.com/Sklyan1878/portfolio/blob/main/7.%20taxi_time_prediction.ipynb) | The company "Sharp Taxi" has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. The company wants to attract more drivers during peak times.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) |
|8. [Determining the Age of Customers](https://github.com/Sklyan1878/portfolio/blob/main/8.%20age_prediction.ipynb) | The chain supermarket "Bread-Salt" is implementing a computer vision system to process photos of customers. Photo capturing at the checkout area will help determine the age of clients in order to: (1) Analyze purchases and suggest products that may interest buyers of that age group.; (2) Monitor the honesty of cashiers when selling alcohol.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Keras-f36a6d) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matplotlib-9cf)|
